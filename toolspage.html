        <h1><strong>TOOLS</strong></h1>
        <p>There are several different tools and technologies that the Gravy Seals will use to complete this project.</p>
        <div class="content-box">
            
            <h2>GitHub: latest version</h2>
            <p>Throughout this project we will be using GitHub to version control both our website and Application build. GitHub will also host the code and find any conflicts when merging other members code. Six out of the Seven Gravy Seal team members have prior experience using GitHub and are confident using its features.</p>
            
            <h2>Atom: v1.60.0</h2>
            <p>Mac Gravy Seal users will be using Atom to edit any code. This is the preferred editor of choice for the Mac users on the team. All users have prior experience using Atom software.</p>
            
            <h2>Notepad ++: v8.5.5</h2>
            <p>Windows Gravy Seal users will be using Notepad ++ to edit any code. This is the preferred editor of choice for the Windows users on the team. All users except one has prior experience using Notepad ++.</p>
            
            <h2>Microsoft Teams: v1.6.00.19353</h2>
            <p>Microsoft Teams is our communication platform of choice. All team members have prior experience using the software and are comfortable with its features. We use MS Teams to collaborate on documents, host meetings and give regular updates on our project progress. </p>
            
            <h2>Trello: latest version</h2>
            <p>We use Trello throughout the project to keep track on what tasks have been completed and what tasks still need to be done. We also use Trello to keep track of any bugs / issues with the software. All team members have experience using Trello. </p>
            
            <h2>X-Code: v15.0</h2>
            <p>We will be using X-Code to create and code the iOS application. Only a handful of our team members have experience using X-Code. X-Code is Apples own iOS application developer software that allows you to develop, test and distribute applications for all Apple platforms including iPhone, Apple TV, iPad and Mac. </p>
            
            <h2>Mac: running Ventura 13.4 or later</h2>
            <p>To use X-Code, we will need to use a Mac (iMac, Macbook or MacMini) running Ventura 13.4 or later. This is a requirement to use X-Code 15.0</p>
            
            <h2>API: latest version</h2>
            <p>The application will be making API calls to a server that hosts all the meal and ingredient data. This allows for the application to stay up to date without the need to update the application itself. About half of the Gravy Seals have experience dealing with and integrating API calls. </p>
            
            <h2>iPhone: X or later running iOS 14 or later</h2>
            <p>The application will be developed on the latest version of X-Code which can develop software for iPhone X or later and for iOS 14 or later. </p>
