            <h2>JAYSON</h2>
            <p>In the transition from A2, the group hit the ground running and tried to organise and choose things to
                work on, following that we tried to get things ready before the last two weeks of the project due date
                to have time to finalize things. ... Our GitHub log also reflects contributions well since we asked each
                member to be responsible for uploading their work so that all members could have contributions.</p>

            <h2>KEATON</h2>
            <p>As we wrapped on Assignment 2 and started planning on Assignment 3 I was hopeful that the team would be
                able to carry through to the end of the semester as an effective working group. ... I believe we have
                worked well as a distributed team.</p>

            <h2>ANGUS</h2>
            <p>As we approached Assignment 3, I felt optimistic, believing we would smoothly navigate through the
                project's requirements given our recent momentum as a team. ... This strategic move allowed us to
                progressively enhance the website in tandem with our report's development.</p>

            <h2>NATHAN</h2>
            <p>Leading on from A2, the group continued to work well as a team. ... The GitHub log reflects the group
                contribution quite well as each member is responsible for uploading the work they did on the project.
            </p>

            <h2>NICHOLAS</h2>
            <p>Continuing on from A2, the Gravy Seals team continued to work well together. ... Working with the Gravy
                Seals has been a great throughout all of the assignments. They are a great bunch of people to work with.
            </p>

            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>Throughout the transition from Assignment 2 to 3, the Gravy Seals team demonstrated a great ability to
                adapt and collaborate, even with geographical and time differences. The group hit the ground running,
                realizing the swiftness with which project timelines can progress. While there were challenges in
                synchronizing team meetings and balancing individual priorities, the foundation built during Assignment
                2 bolstered the group's trust and ensured that they met their objectives. A significant highlight was
                the team's early initiative to set up the website, allowing simultaneous enhancement alongside the
                project report. Consistent communication emerged as a critical component for the group, ensuring clarity
                and fostering a positive work environment. Regular meetings, both scheduled and informal, coupled with
                tools like GitHub and MS Teams, facilitated transparency and efficiency. Despite the occasional
                challenges, the Gravy Seals team maintained their productivity and camaraderie, making the collaborative
                experience rewarding for all members. </p>
