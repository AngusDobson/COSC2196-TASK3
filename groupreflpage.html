            <h2>JAYSON</h2>
            <p>In the transition from A2, the group hit the ground running and tried to organise and choose things to
                work on, following that we tried to get things ready before the last two weeks of the project due date
                to have time to finalize things. It was very surprising how fast the last 4 weeks can go leading up to
                the end of the project and I need to account for that busy time moving forward! Another surprising thing
                honestly was that the group was so coordinated despite differences in time zones and working hours. One
                thing that could have been improved on would have been having someone designated for each meeting to
                write down a list of things to talk about to make sure we covered everything. Our GitHub log also
                reflects contributions well since we asked each member to be responsible for uploading their work so
                that all members could have contributions. </p>

            <h2>KEATON</h2>
            <p>As we wrapped on Assignment 2 and started planning on Assignment 3 I was hopeful that the team would be
                able to carry through to the end of the semester as an effective working group. Finding a way to balance
                the last 4 weeks of study with competing priorities from other courses, illnesses in the team as well as
                finding a time to meet as a group did prove a challenge for us however, I believe that because we had a
                strong foundation from Assignment 2 we were able to trust each other to get the work done. In the last
                week we were able to come together and make quick decisions on any last-minute value add work that we
                could do, including building a demo of our project. Overall, given our competing priorities and the
                challenges we have had organizing times to come together, I believe we have worked well as a distributed
                team.</p>

            <h2>ANGUS</h2>
            <p>As we approached Assignment 3, I felt optimistic, believing we would smoothly navigate through the
                project's requirements given our recent momentum as a team. Yet, coordinating team meetings proved
                challenging, often only seeing half the team in attendance. Regardless of these hurdles, our collective
                effort enabled us to consistently meet our weekly objectives, culminating in what I perceive as a
                successful project brief. A notable improvement during this assignment was our proactive approach to
                initiating the website early on. This strategic move allowed us to progressively enhance the website in
                tandem with our report's development. </p>

            <h2>NATHAN</h2>
            <p>Leading on from A2, the group continued to work well as a team. Everyone completed their work in a timely
                manner to have the backend two weeks to focus on the presentation and any final adjustments to the A3
                document. An area that we could improve on as a team is maybe re-adjusting when our meetings are held
                from week to week to fully cater for any complex schedule changes. One surprising thing from our group
                was how knowledgeable the team was regarding html and setting up websites. Going into this subject I had
                never even seen html before, and it was good to be able to ask questions to the group in teams to aid in
                adding my sections to the website. One thing I have learnt about group work is the importance of regular
                communication. In previous group environments that I have been involved in we did not have meetings and
                communicated remotely. This usually resulted in poor processes which slowed the work down. The GitHub
                log reflects the group contribution quite well as each member is responsible for uploading the work they
                did on the project.</p>

            <h2>NICHOLAS</h2>
            <p>Continuing on from A2, the Gravy Seals team continued to work well together. The collaborative efforts
                from everyone in the team were commendable throughout the course of this assignment. We again were able
                to effectively allocate tasks amongst ourselves and maintained our regular check-ins, whether these be
                during our scheduled meetings or through our daily chats on MS Teams. There was a relaxed demeanor and
                positive work environment amongst our team, with effective communication allowing all members of our
                team to voice their thoughts, opinions and offer insights as needed. Our meetings were productive and
                were a place where our team could again voice any concerns or opinions.</p>
            <p>Again, given our different locations in the world and individual commitments, it was at times difficult
                to find a common meeting time. We instead kept our regular Tuesday and Saturday meetings at the same
                time weekly, and those who could not attend would review the meeting recordings and make any comments on
                them as needed. We would then follow up with each other through the chat on MS Teams. Working with the
                Gravy Seals has been a great throughout all of the assignments. They are a great bunch of people to work
                with. </p>

            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>During the transition from Assignment 2 to 3, the Gravy Seals team continued to showcase how well they are able to adapt and collaborate with each other, regardless of geographical location and time zone disparities. Our team continued to regularly meet every Tuesday and Saturday, with those unable to meet watching over meeting recordings and making any comments or contributions that they saw fit. <br><br>

Aside from the regular meetings, our team would continue to check in with each other daily on MS Teams to see how each task is progressing and if anyone was stuck or needed any help on their sections. Lessons learnt from working with the Gravy Seals team is how invaluable regular check ins are with each other as they gave us an insight to how the project was progressing. <br><br>

The collaboration between the group was again very productive, with all team members noting equal contributions amongst the entire team not only in completing designated tasks, but also in taking initiative, putting their hand up to contribute more and driving the projects progression forward.  <br><br>

While the team was productive there were still some challenges along the way. Synchronizing team meetings and balancing individual team members personal commitments and priorities was again at times difficult, although the foundations set from assignment 2 reinforced the teams trust in each other. Each individual was personally responsible for their own work and ensured that they met their objectives and met the deadlines and expectations from the team. <br><br>

On the other hand, a highlight was the teams early initiative to setup the website template, which allowed for simultaneous contributions instead of a last minute rush to upload all the content in the final week. Our GitHub log also reflects contributions relatively well as we asked for each team member to be responsible for uploading their own work so that all members would have some contributions logged. In the final week of the assignment leading up to the due date, our team was able to come together and make quick decisions on any last minute additions or work that we can do to the project that might add value to the project overall. This was when the decision to build a working demo of our project was made.
