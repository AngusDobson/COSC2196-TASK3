            <p>Leading on from A2, the group continued to work well as a team. Everyone completed their work in a timely manner to have the backend two weeks to focus on the presentation and any final adjustments to the A3 document. An area that we could improve on as a team is maybe re-adjusting when our meetings are held from week to week to fully cater for any complex schedule changes. One surprising thing from our group was how knowledgeable the team was regarding html and setting up websites. Going into this subject I had never even seen html before, and it was good to be able to ask questions to the group in teams to aid in adding my sections to the website. One thing I have learnt about group work is the importance of regular communication. In previous group environments that I have been involved in we did not have meetings and communicated remotely. This usually resulted in poor processes which slowed the work down. The GitHub log reflects the group contribution quite well as each member is responsible for uploading the work they did on the project. <br><br>
