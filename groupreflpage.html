            <h2>NATHAN</h2>
            <p>Leading on from A2, the group continued to work well as a team. Everyone completed their work in a timely manner to have the backend two weeks to focus on the presentation and any final adjustments to the A3 document. An area that we could improve on as a team is maybe re-adjusting when our meetings are held from week to week to fully cater for any complex schedule changes. One surprising thing from our group was how knowledgeable the team was regarding html and setting up websites. Going into this subject I had never even seen html before, and it was good to be able to ask questions to the group in teams to aid in adding my sections to the website. One thing I have learnt about group work is the importance of regular communication. In previous group environments that I have been involved in we did not have meetings and communicated remotely. This usually resulted in poor processes which slowed the work down. The GitHub log reflects the group contribution quite well as each member is responsible for uploading the work they did on the project. <br><br>

                 <h2>NICHOLAS</h2>
            <p>Continuing on from A2, the Gravy Seals team continued to work well together. The collaborative efforts from everyone in the team were commendable throughout the course of this assignment. We again were able to effectively allocate tasks amongst ourselves and maintained our regular check-ins, whether these be during our scheduled meetings or through our daily chats on MS Teams. There was a relaxed demeanor and positive work environment amongst our team, with effective communication allowing all members of our team to voice their thoughts, opinions and offer insights as needed. Our meetings were productive and were a place where our team could again voice any concerns or opinions. <br><br>

Again, given our different locations in the world and individual commitments, it was at times difficult to find a common meeting time. We instead kept our regular Tuesday and Saturday meetings at the same time weekly, and those who could not attend would review the meeting recordings and make any comments on them as needed. We would then follow up with each other through the chat on MS Teams. Working with the Gravy Seals has been a great throughout all of the assignments. They are a great bunch of people to work with.

            <h2>Keaton</h2>
            <p>As we wrapped on Assignment 2 and started planning on Assignment 3 I was hopeful that the team would be able to carry through to the end of the semester as an effective working group. Finding a way to balance the last 4 weeks of study with competing priorities from other courses, illnesses in the team as well as finding a time to meet as a group did prove a challenge for us however, I believe that because we had a strong foundation from Assignment 2 we were able to trust each other to get the work done. In the last week we were able to come together and make quick decisions on any last-minute value add work that we could do, including building a demo of our project. Overall, given our competing priorities and the challenges we have had organizing times to come together, I believe we have worked well as a distributed team. </p>
