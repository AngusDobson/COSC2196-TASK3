            <h2>RISKS</h2>
            <p>In general, all projects will come with risks no matter how big or small a business is. A startup group like us comes with significantly more risk than an established business. We may have to purchase tools and technology to be able to complete our project which will come with the risk of the tech we purchase not being able to fully complete the task we need it to complete. This of course can be mitigated by detailed research into each type of tool and technology noting all its advantages and disadvantages.  <br><br>
                Stemming from this risk and the most important thing to be careful about is financial risk. The team could certainly opt to only utilize the resources, tools and technologies they already own, which would essentially remove financial risk from the equation completely. However, if we want to compete in the market for paying customers, we may need to branch out and purchase additional tools and technologies or even pitch our application to potential investors. <br><br>
                If we were to succeed in acquiring investors, that would then add another layer of risk. As investors will want a return on their investment and may even want a deadline for a working application to be completed by. If the Dinnerizer fails to produce a return, then the group members may have to pay investors back with our own money or the investors could pull out of the project completely. <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
            <p>From the onset of forming the gravy seals, the group has been meeting twice a week on teams using the inbuilt meeting function. As our members are located all over the world with different time zones, the meetings have been designed to cater as best we can for all members. However, not all members can attend every meeting and for this reason we record the meetings and send out notes afterwards. If a member misses the meeting, they are required to watch the recording and add any comments to the general discussion in teams. <br><br>
                If a group member does not respond to communications, we give roughly a one-week leniency because most members have jobs and live in different time zones. If they fail to communicate within the week one member will reach out to that member directly for any clarifications. If no response from a direct message, then the team would have no choice but to escalate it to the RMIT staff. Fortunately, this has not happened with any member of the gravy seals. <br><br>
