    <h1><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></h1>
    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <h3>Topic</h3>
      <p>The proposed project revolves around the development of Dinnerizer, a digital meal planning tool designed for
        mobile and desktop platforms. This application aims to streamline the meal preparation process, offering a
        multitude of dinner suggestions tailored to users' dietary needs, preferences, and ingredient availability. With
        an organized grocery list generated for each meal plan, Dinnerizer aims to facilitate efficient shopping, reduce
        food waste, and promote diverse home-cooked meals. The motivation behind this project lies in enhancing the
        overall cooking experience, making meal planning more efficient, enjoyable, and accessible for all users,
        irrespective of their dietary preferences or physical abilities.</p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>The motivation for the Dinnerizer project stems from the need to simplify daily meal decisions, which are often
        time-consuming and stressful. This project aligns with the growing IT trends in the field of food technology and
        mobile applications, with an emphasis on personalization and accessibility. It will demonstrate our ability to
        apply technical skills in real-world contexts, creating a practical, user-friendly solution to an everyday
        problem. Completing this project will demonstrate our team's proficiency in Java programming, UI/UX design, data
        management, and responsiveness to user feedback. Future employers will value this experience, seeing our
        capabilities in application development, problem-solving, and understanding user needs.</p>

      <h3>Landscape</h3>
      <p>The current landscape of meal planning applications is relatively diverse, with apps such as Mealime (Mealime,
        2023), Plan to Eat (Plan to Eat, 2023), and Yummly (Yummly, 2023) offering various features ranging from
        personalized meal plans to dietary tracking. However, Dinnerizer distinguishes itself with its focus on reducing
        food waste and promoting accessibility. This focus aligns with the Food and Agriculture Organization's emphasis
        on food waste reduction and the role of technology (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
        2021). The app recommends meals based on the specific ingredients that users already have, which is a feature
        not common in many existing apps. Dinnerizer fills a gap in the market for a more inclusive meal planning app by
        considering users with disabilities. Its commitment to continuous improvement via user feedback, combined with
        the use of lightweight databases like SQLite for improved scalability and search functionality (SQLite, 2023),
        add a layer of innovation to this project, demonstrating the application of machine learning principles to the
        profession of meal planning (Darcy, Louie, and Roberts, 2016).</p>

      <h2>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <h3>Aims – Revolutionise meal-planning</h3>
      <p>The aim of Dinnerizer is to revolutionize meal planning by creating an innovative meal planning app that
        provides comprehensive meal-plans for users, this will streamline how they plan for meals, as well as aid in
        grocery shopping. By making a user-friendly and personalized app. Dinnerizer seeks to redefine how people plan
        their meals, making it more efficient, enjoyable, and timesaving.</p>

      <h3>Goal 1:</h3>
      <p>If this project is to succeed, we need to create an extensive database of dinner options that are tailored to
        users’ preferences, diet, and lifestyle. This goal is necessary as a strong database will enable the app to
        generate personalized meal plans that can cater to their individual tastes, and consider all factors like
        dietary restrictions, allergies, cultural preferences etc. If we can achieve this goal, it will lay the
        foundation for a highly customizable meal-planning experience.</p>

      <h3>Goal 2:</h3>
      <p>The second goal is to create an intelligent recommendation system using data science. If we analyze user
        behavior and meal choices, the application will offer smart, data-driven meal suggestions that can adapt and
        improve over time. This goal is particularly vital as it will enhance user engagement, increase product
        satisfaction, as well as promote healthier and more diverse eating habits among users.</p>

      <h3>Goal 3:</h3>
      <p>The Third goal is to integrate a comprehensive grocery shopping feature for the application. This goal will
        complement the meal planning process and ensure that users can manage their shopping lists based on the meals
        they have selected. This system should minimize waste and identify items that the user is commonly purchasing.
      </p>

      <h3>Goal 4:</h3>
      <p>The last goal is to ensure a seamless user experience across as many devices and platforms as possible.
        Developing a responsive, user-friendly interface for both mobile and web versions is especially critical in
        achieving widespread usage. If we can prioritize a consistent and intuitive user interface, the application will
        appeal to a broader audience and encourage long-term usage.</p>

      <p>With these four goals outlined we can guide the project's development and decision-making process. If
        challenges or constraints are to arise, these goals can assist us in prioritizing the most important aspects of
        the project and ensure that the core features related to revolutionizing meal planning are given the highest
        priority.</p>

      <h2>PLANS AND PROGRESS</h2>

      <h3>Story:</h3>
      <p>The idea for the Dinnerizer app was born out of a shared frustration among the team members with the
        tediousness of meal planning and grocery shopping. We saw an opportunity to revolutionize the way people plan
        their meals and make it more efficient, personalized, and enjoyable. Our vision was to create a comprehensive
        meal planning application that would cater to a user's individual preferences, dietary needs, and lifestyle
        choices while also attempting to automate the entire process of creating a grocery shopping list.</p>

      <h3>Progress:</h3>
      <p>Over the past weeks, we have made considerable progress towards developing the Dinnerizer application. We began
        by doing market research by analyzing comparable products on the market to understand what exactly is available,
        which includes what their products are bringing to the table, as well as the key points where their products are
        lacking which has helped us to pinpoint key aspects to focus on.</p>

      <h3>Technical Development:</h3>
      <p>The technical development for Dinnerizer will begin with creating a scalable backend infrastructure. We will
        have our Lead Software Developer lead the team in designing and implementing a backend system. With this we can
        have a solid foundation for handling user data, authentication and managing dinner options.</p>

      <h3>User Interface and Experience:</h3>
      <p>Our UI/UX designer role will be working hard on wireframes and mock-ups to design a visually appealing and
        intuitive user interface. Once these are completed, we will be able to conduct usability testing and have a look
        at the feedback, which will enable us to make informed design alterations. As a result of that we can create a
        truly user-friendly interface that will guide users through the meal planning process seamlessly.</p>

      <h3>Grocery Shopping Integration:</h3>
      <p>To enhance the grocery shopping experience, we are working on integrating the application with popular online
        grocery platforms and creating an algorithm to optimize users’ shopping lists. By analyzing the meal plans, the
        system will be able to generate an optimized shopping list, which will reduce waste and ensure a smooth grocery
        shopping process.</p>

      <h3>Current Stage:</h3>
      <p>As of now, we are at the infant stages of development, but when these core features are implemented and tested
        we can focus on refining the user experience, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and conducting extensive
        testing to identify and address any potential issues before our official launch.</p>

      <h3>Future Plans:</h3>
      <p>Moving forward, our plans involve launching the Dinnerizer application on both iOS and Android platforms, as
        well as making it accessible as a Web Application. We want to collaborate with a range of people including
        professional chefs and nutritionists to expand the database of options and provide users with a wider variety of
        recipes to align with their goals and keep the quality of our product high.</p>

      <h3>Handover:</h3>
      <p>If we were to hand this project over to a new team, we would need ensure that our engineers are keeping
        detailed documentation on the application architecture, data models, APIS etc so that they are able to pick up
        where we left off. We would also share our research findings and feedback on testing so that the new team can
        understand the needs of users and capitalize on this information. We would also need our code repository to be
        organized so that we can have a smooth transition on code handover.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>The Dinnerizer project has come a long way since its initial inception. We are so excited about the affect this
        application could have meal planning for both individuals and families! With our aim of revolutionizing meal
        planning, we have the opportunity to develop a feature-rich app that will cater to all users’ needs and
        preferences. We believe that Dinnerizer has the potential to become the market leader as a meal planning
        platform, which will simplify the lives of users and encourage healthier eating habits! As we move to the
        development stage, we are confident that we have laid the groundwork for future growth of the app.</p>

      <h2>ROLES</h2>
      <p>The following roles have been identified for the successful delivery of the Dinnerizer project. The makeup of
        the team is intentionally smaller, to keep both budget and agility in focus, loosely based on the Spotify Squad
        model (Curth N.D).</p>

        the Lead Software Developer will create a project roadmap to inform technical specifications that the
        development team will follow.</p>
      <p>The Software Developer role is responsible for delivering the Product Manager and Lead Software Developers
        project to fruition by translating the technical specifications and project roadmap into features. As individual
        contributors, they will focus on building both frontend and backend components out for the Dinnerizer project.
      </p>
      <p>The UI/UX Designers work with the Product Manager and Software Developers to design intuitive and visually
        appealing interfaces that strengthen satisfaction and engagement from the user. The UI/UX Designers enable the
        Product Manager to visualize their product features aiding with feedback and iterative feature design, working
        to finalize designs prior to the development of the frontend components.</p>

      <h2>SCOPE AND LIMITS</h2>
      <p>During the development phase of our Dinnerizer project, the project team will be focused on delivering the
        features that have been defined by the Product Manager, and any supporting features for the technical platform
        as set out by the Lead Software Developer. The Product Manager and Lead Software Developer will work together to
        define a clear scope and roadmap, ensuring that we’re only delivering what’s minimally viable for the project.
      </p>
      <p>The project will focus on providing users the ability to receive recipe suggestions based on their dietary
        needs and availability of ingredients. The project will not include the features related to incorporating a
        users preference for meals by cuisine or taste. Additionally, the project will focus on generating organised
        shopping lists for the recipes that have been suggested, and will remove features related to reducing food waste
        and efficiencies in shopping from the initial scope. This enables the team to focus on the core functionality of
        the application and will enable the Product Manager to gather feedback and usage insights from users. This
        feedback will guide the future roadmap of the project if it is decided to be worth pursuing.</p>

      <h2>RISKS</h2>
      <p>In general, all projects will come with risks no matter how big or small a business is. A startup group like us
        comes with significantly more risk than an established business. We may have to purchase tools and technology to
        be able to complete our project which will come with the risk of the tech we purchase not being able to fully
        complete the task we need it to complete. This of course can be mitigated by detailed research into each type of
        tool and technology noting all its advantages and disadvantages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stemming from this risk and the most important thing to be careful about is financial risk. The team could
        certainly opt to only utilize the resources, tools and technologies they already own, which would essentially
        remove financial risk from the equation completely. However, if we want to compete in the market for paying
        customers, we may need to branch out and purchase additional tools and technologies or even pitch our
        application to potential investors.</p>
      <p>
        If we were to succeed in acquiring investors, that would then add another layer of risk. As investors will want
        a return on their investment and may even want a deadline for a working application to be completed by. If the
        Dinnerizer fails to produce a return, then the group members may have to pay investors back with our own money
        or the investors could pull out of the project completely.
      </p>

      <h2>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
      <p>From the onset of forming the gravy seals, the group has been meeting twice a week on teams using the inbuilt
        meeting function. As our members are located all over the world with different time zones, the meetings have
        been designed to cater as best we can for all members. However, not all members can attend every meeting and for
        this reason we record the meetings and send out notes afterwards. If a member misses the meeting, they are
        required to watch the recording and add any comments to the general discussion in teams.</p>
      <p>If a group member does not respond to communications, we give roughly a one-week leniency because most members
        have jobs and live in different time zones. If they fail to communicate within the week one member will reach
        out to that member directly for any clarifications. If no response from a direct message, then the team would
        have no choice but to escalate it to the RMIT staff. Fortunately, this has not happened with any member of the
        gravy seals.</p>
