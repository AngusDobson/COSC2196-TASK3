            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <p>
                The following roles have been identified for the successful delivery of the Dinnerizer project. The makeup of the team is intentionally smaller, to keep both budget and agility in focus.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product Manager</li>
                <li>Lead Software Developer</li>
                <li>Software Developer</li>
                <li>UI/UX Designer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Product Manager role ensures the overall success of the project, by leading feature design, direction and priority. The Product Manager role will spend time understanding the market trends and needs of our customers. The combination of project management and customer specification elicitation skills enables the Dinnerizer project to deliver a project that meets the customers needs, and aligns with the business goals and priorities.</p>

            <p>The Lead Software Developer will guide the technical direction of the project, establishing and maintaining software development standards through technical expertise and leadership. Together with the Product Manager, the Lead Software Developer will create a project roadmap to inform technical specifications that the development team will follow.</p>

            <p>The Software Developer role is responsible for delivering the Product Manager and Lead Software Developers project to fruition by translating the technical specifications and project roadmap into features. As individual contributors, they will focus on building both frontend and backend components out for the Dinnerizer project.</p>

            <p>The UI/UX Designers work with the Product Manager and Software Developers to design intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that strengthen satisfaction and engagement from the user. The UI/UX Designers enable the Product Manager to visualise their product features aiding with feedback and iterative feature design, working to finalise designs prior to the development of the frontend components.  </p>

            <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

            <p>During the development phase of our Dinnerizer project, the project team will be focused on delivering the features that have been defined by the Product Manager, and any supporting features for the technical platform as set out by the Lead Software Developer. The Product Manager and Lead Software Developer will work together to define a clear scope and roadmap, ensuring that we’re only delivering what’s minimally viable for the project.</p>
            <p>The project will focus on providing users the ability to receive recipe suggestions based on their dietary needs and availability of ingredients. The project will not include the features related to incorporating a users preference for meals by cuisine or taste. Additionally, the project will focus on generating organised shopping lists for the recipes that have been suggested, and will remove features related to reducing food waste and efficiencies in shopping from the initial scope. This enables the team to focus on the core functionality of the application and will enable the Product Manager to gather feedback and usage insights from users. This feedback will guide the future roadmap of the project if it is decided to be worth pursuing.</p>
