He has lived in numerous states going where the work took him. Nathan has a strong passion for health and fitness and adheres to a strict gym routine and meal plan.

Raised in Australia, Angus is bilingual, speaking both English and Japanese, and a passionate plant enthusiast, owning several rare and exotic plant species, most recently a Monstera Borsigiana Albo.

            <h2>GROUP PROCESSES</h2>
            <p></p>

            <h2>CAREER PLANS</h2>
            <p><strong>Jayson:</strong> Jayson wants to become a Backend Engineer. As he plans to follow this path in a foreign country, he must take a path that might be a little different from others. Firstly, language is important, so it must be constantly studied and practiced. Secondly, experience is a must in Tokyo as they basically do not hire people for entry-level positions, so he is currently working on freelance projects to build a portfolio and must have an impressive one to land a job.</p>
            <p><strong>Keaton:</strong> Keaton has spent the last 5 years as a Full Stack Software developer in Canada and wishes to continue with this path by further developing in-depth knowledge of software development and different technologies at scale. Keaton has also spent some time in leadership roles and would like to focus more on a technical leadership track instead of a people management track. Long term, Keaton would like to develop a web application or service that can be self-developed and managed to operate as a lifestyle business and eventually transition out of full-time work into self-employment through this business.</p>
            <p><strong>Angus:</strong> Angus aspires to become a UI/UX Developer. Given his passion for creating intuitive user interfaces and ensuring seamless user experience, he plans to approach this career path methodically. To begin with, Angus will bolster his existing knowledge in web development, with a focus on front-end frameworks such as React and Angular, which are popular in UI/UX design. Simultaneously, he intends to deepen his understanding of design principles by self-studying and taking relevant online courses. In order to gain practical experience and to demonstrate his skills to potential employers, Angus will work on personal projects and contribute to open-source projects. He also plans on building a robust portfolio, showcasing his designs and the user experiences he has created. As a part of his long-term career strategy, Angus will look for entry-level positions in companies that offer growth in the field of UI/UX design. Ultimately, his goal is to work in a challenging environment that encourages innovation and creativity in UI/UX development.</p>
            <p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Nathan’s ideal job is an investment analyst/portfolio manager. To achieve this job role, he will need extensive experience in the financial sector and proof of involvement in investing. So, the plan after finishing his degree is to take any finance job that he can get just for a foot in the door, then work his way up from there expanding his knowledge and skillset. As for proof of involvement in investing Nathan currently manages his own small portfolio and keeps detailed records of each trade in the hopes to be able to build it up and use it to show employers his skillset.</p>
